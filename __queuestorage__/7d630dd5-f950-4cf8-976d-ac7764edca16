This research focuses on analyzing informationtechnology risk management in Indonesian educational institutions using the ISO 31000framework. The study aims to minimize the occurrence and impact of various informationtechnology risks that can disrupt organizational processes. Through a comprehensiveexamination encompassing risk assessment, analysis, evaluation, and treatment, thisresearch provides valuable insights into identifying potential risks within educationalinstitutions. Furthermore, the findings serve as a reference for formulating riskmanagement policies, enabling institutions to proactively mitigate the possibility ofinformation technology risks and their future impact. By adopting the ISO 31000framework, educational institutions can enhance their efficiency, effectiveness, andaccessibility while safeguarding against potential disruptions.Keywords: information technology, risk management, ISO 31000, educational institution1.INTRODUCTIONIn the era of globalization, information technology is rapidly advancing, impactingvarious institutions in Indonesia, including health, legal, social, economic, andeducational institutions. The integration of information technology is essential,particularly in educational institutions, where it serves as a vital support for dailybusiness activities, improving academic services and striving towards institutionalgoals. Furthermore, information technology plays a crucial role in enablingeducational institutions to compete in the current era of globalization [1].Consequently, the implementation of information technology is imperative fordiverse educational institutions in Indonesia.Presently, one particular educational institution in Indonesia has successfullyintegrated information technology into its daily business processes. An exampleof this integration is the utilization of SIAHDU (Integrated School InformationSystem) for processing administrative data and information related to students.SIAHDU, a custom-built application system, manages student administrative data630CcBYThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.e-ISSN: 2656-4882Journal of Information Systems and InformaticsVol. 5, No. 2, June 2023http://journal-isi.org/index.php/isip-ISSN: 2656-5935such as violation records, biographical information, grades, attendance, and reportcards within the institution. Accessible to teachers, school staff, students, andparents, SIAHDU is complemented by additional application systems, such asSIKADU (Integrated Academic System) and SISMINDO (IntegratedAdministrative System). While leveraging information technology offerssignificant benefits, it is essential to acknowledge the potential risks that can affectthe optimal performance of these application systems [2]. Such risks, stemmingfrom various factors, can disrupt the ongoing business processes or activitieswithin educational institutions. Additionally, the effective execution of anorganization's business processes necessitates skilled human resources and robustsystems and infrastructure [3]. Therefore, conducting an analysis of informationtechnology risk management at these educational institutions becomes imperative.Risk management encompasses a set of policies and procedures owned byorganizations, enabling them to effectively manage, monitor, and control riskswithin their operations [4]. By implementing risk management practices,organizations can protect themselves from potential risks and mitigate their impacton business processes, ultimately facilitating the achievement of organizationalgoals [5]. Consequently, risk management garners significant interest withinorganizations as it aids in minimizing potential losses caused by unforeseen risks.The integration of information technology into educational institutions haswitnessed rapid growth in recent years, including within Indonesia. Thisintegration has yielded numerous advantages, such as enhanced efficiency,effectiveness, and information accessibility. However, it has also introduced arange of information technology risks capable of disrupting the daily businessprocesses of educational institutions. These risks encompass cyber threats, databreaches, system failures, and human errors. Given the pivotal role of informationtechnology in educational institutions, it is crucial to ensure the effectivemanagement of associated risks. Accordingly, this research proposes the utilizationof the ISO 31000 framework as a comprehensive guide for analyzing informationtechnology risk management in Indonesian educational institutions. Widelyrecognized and accepted as a standard for risk management, this framework offersa structured and systematic approach to risk identification, assessment, andtreatment. The research endeavors to identify potential information technologyrisks present in Indonesian educational institutions, assess their likelihood andpotential impact, and develop a risk treatment plan aimed at minimizing both theoccurrence and impact of these risks. The findings of this research will offervaluable insights to educational institutions in Indonesia, aiding in theidentification of risks within their organizations and the formulation of policies toeffectively address them. Ultimately, this research aims to reduce the likelihoodand impact of information technology risks, ensuring seamless operations withinIndonesian educational institutions.Niken Lusia Putri, Agustinus Fritz Wijaya | 631\\\"\"]","ParentTraceContext":null,"Tags":null,"EventId":1,"IsPlayed":false,"Timestamp":"2025-06-20T15:09:35.3249013Z"},"SequenceNumber":0,"OrchestrationInstance":{"$type":"DurableTask.Core.OrchestrationInstance","InstanceId":"b6e84e7417f44f2faed41ba33b117698","ExecutionId":"d4400aba-7fa2-4367-abd0-ebd546122e79"},"OrchestrationExecutionContext":{"$type":"DurableTask.Core.OrchestrationExecutionContext","OrchestrationTags":{"$type":"System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[[System.String, System.Private.CoreLib],[System.String, System.Private.CoreLib]]"}}},"CompressedBlobName":null,"SequenceNumber":4,"Episode":2,"Sender":{"InstanceId":"b6e84e7417f44f2faed41ba33b117698","ExecutionId":"d4400aba-7fa2-4367-abd0-ebd546122e79"},"SerializableTraceContext":null}{"$type":"DurableTask.AzureStorage.MessageData","ActivityId":"3c81fd44-c2f6-42a9-8c9a-83b1a2a4e326","TaskMessage":{"$type":"DurableTask.Core.TaskMessage","Event":{"$type":"DurableTask.Core.History.TaskCompletedEvent","EventType":5,"TaskScheduledId":1,"Result":"{\"content\":\"The study, conducted by Niken Lusia Putri and Agustinus Fritz Wijaya, focuses on managing information technology risks in Indonesian educational institutions using the ISO 31000 framework.
